# 📊 Android Benchmarks Project

This project demonstrates performance benchmarking for an Android application using Jetpack Compose, and Hilt. It includes a list of items in Compose that navigates to a detail screen and showcases benchmarking for startup time and scroll performance.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Jetpack Compose Navigation:
Displays a LazyColumn list of items.
Allows clicking on each item to navigate to a detail screen.
- Performance Benchmarking:
Benchmarks for app startup time and scrolling performance using Macrobenchmark.
Tests different compilation modes: None and Partial.
- Hilt for Dependency Injection:
Simplifies dependency management and promotes clean architecture.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Kotlin: Core language for Android development.
- Jetpack Compose: For building a modern, declarative UI.
- Hilt: Simplifies dependency injection.
- Macrobenchmark Library: Measures startup and runtime performance.
- UIAutomator: For UI interactions and scroll testing in benchmarks.
